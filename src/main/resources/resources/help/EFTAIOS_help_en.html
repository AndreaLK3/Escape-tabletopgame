User's manual<br>
<br>
This manual only deals with the digital version of the game, for general rules<br>

<br>
<h4><big><big>Client operations, aka Play the Actual game</big></big></h4>
<big>
<small style="text-decoration: underline;">Preparations</small><br>
</big>
<ol>
  <li>Set the port number in the main menu, the default 1337 works most of the times</li>
  <li>Click Start Client, then enter the ip / hostname of the server you want to join</li>
  <li>Wait for the game to start</li>
  <li>A popup will notify you when your turn starts<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The main interface</span><br>
The connection status, game status and turn number are displayed on the top row.<br>
The left side of the screen contains the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">tactical panel</span>", showing the info you possess<br>
about yourself and the other players, those data are automatically gathered by the game<br>
for your convenience.<br>
<br>
Under the global data about all the players are located the specific <span style="font-weight: bold;">info about your character</span>:<br>
name, status, team. You may change your name by editing it and pressing enter.<br>
<br>
Under your personal data, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">turn status</span> is displayed (who is currently playing)<br>
<br>
The in-game <span style="font-weight: bold;">chat</span> interface is located at the bottom of the left panel, you can use it as any other<br>
chat system you've seen before.<br>
<br>
The right of the screen is occupied by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">game map</span>, it will show your position, as well as any<br>
noteworthy event occurring during the game; to move your character, place noises, or turn on<br>
the lights, you must select a cell by clicking it.<br>
<br>
Finally, the bottom row of the interface contains the <span style="font-weight: bold;">view object cards</span> button, it shows a dialog<br>
with the cards that are currently in your possession. When you have to play a card, simply bring<br>
it up, click on the card, and press ok.<br>
When you have drawn a new card, an hint is displayed in the bottom left of the screen.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The turn sequence</span><br>
The turn sequence is unchanged from the tabletop version (advanced ruleses), but keep<br>
in mind that turns have a precise time limit (around 60 seconds), and, if you take too much<br>
time, you may lose the rest of your turn<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disconnection<br>
</span>The game abandon is permanent, meaning that you can not disconnect and the reconnect again<br>
and continue the game; disconnected characters won't be removed from the map, but will not<br>
figure among the winners.<br>

<h4><small>
</small><big><big>Server operations</big></big></h4>

<big>
<small style="text-decoration: underline;">Preparations<br>
</small></big>
<ol>
  <li>For the server, it's important to set the right <span style="font-weight: bold;">networking mode</span></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Choose Socket, RMI or Socket + RMI from the Server Settings row, in the main menu</li>
    <li>Please note that the network mode chosen here will influence how the port will be used</li>
  </ul>
  <li>If you want to use a custom <span style="font-weight: bold;">port</span> (1337 is fine most of the times, though) for incoming connections, input it in the "port field", then hit the "set port" button</li>
  <ul>
    <li>NOTE: if you are using RMI, the registry port (1099) will be listening, too.</li>
    <li>OTHER NOTE: if you are using RMI + Socket, RMI will take over the displayed port (i.e. 1337), then Socket will try to listen on the next avaible one (i.e. 1338)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Click "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Start Server</span>", and the server will be up and running in a few seconds.</li>
  <li>Now you may want to communicate your ip/hostname to your users, and let the game begin!<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>To allow others to connect, you may want to open the chosen ports on your <span style="font-weight: bold;">firewall</span>, the exact procedure vary between different operating systems.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: we don't recommend opening
the registry port (1099), as it could compromise the security of your
system.<br>
<ul>
  <li>You may also want to allow connections from the whole internet
(and not just your LAN). To do so, you must configure your
router/gateway to forward said ports; again, the exact <span style="font-weight: bold;">port-forwarding</span> procedure vary between different machines. If you have trouble with port forwarding, these online tools can be helpful: <a href="http://www.yougetsignal.com/">http://www.yougetsignal.com/</a><br>
  </li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: we don't recommend forwarding the registry port, either.<br>
<br style="text-decoration: underline;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The main interface</span><br>
The server interface is rough, and is intended to simply display the <span style="font-weight: bold;">server's logs</span>, be it from the terminal<br>
or inside a window.<br>
The window does also display the server uptime, and offers buttons to:<br>
Stop the server<br>
Dump the logs (the file will show up in your working directory, usually the same as the executable .jar)<br>
<br>
The server process will always try to go down gracefully (whether you stop it via gui or by sending a SIGINT),<br>
by stopping all the games and then disconnecting all the users.<br>
<br>
The server will automatically join new users to the same game; if said
game is full / already running, a new game instance will be created,
new users will be routed here, and so on.<br>
The actual match will also start a fixed amount of time (default: 60
seconds, but it's customizable) after the minimum number of players is
met (2 players).<br>
<br>
<h4><big><big>Command line parameters</big></big></h4>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></h4>
The application is intended to work in <span style="font-weight: bold;">headless environments</span> as well, but you need to use command line parameters to correctly set it up:<br>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 276px;">--gm-timeout [milliseconds]<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 757px;">Set the duration after which the game will automatically start, given a minimum number of players waiting in the game room<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 276px;">--turn-duration [milliseconds]</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 757px;">Set the absolute
duration of a player's turn. When this time runs out, the computer will
automatically concude the turn, in place of the user. The default is 60 seconds.<br>
Note: using this option is not encouraged outside testing/debugging sessions.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>

      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 757px;">Set the port to connect to / to listen on, just like the gui menu does<br>

      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 757px;">(Client only): set
the default address to connect to (you don't have to choose it here,
the cli will ask it anyway when you start the client)<br>

      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 757px;">use RMI instead of the default socket, on both the textual client and server<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 276px;">--net-combo<br>

      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Set which game maps to play,
instead of the default (Galilei). The avaible maps may vary based on
your version of the program. Subsequent game instances will be played
on subsequent maps on the list, the list is roll-over.<br>

<h4><big><big>Not So FAQ:</big></big></h4>
Q: How often will new updates come out?<br>
A: The program is fixed-deadline university project, this means you probably* won't see any updates after June, 2015.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * who knows, life is strange sometimes.<br>
<br>
Q: My computer is an 80s IBM-PC, can I play too?<br>
A: The protocol used by the Socket subsystem employs human-readable
strings (kinda like SMTP does), this means that you can connect to an
eftaios server via telnet / netcat and play, the interface is not so
different from the cli-client provided by the application. Obviouly,
the server must be hosted on a java capable computer.<br>
<br>
Q: Why is this program better than similar projects?<br>
A: We made the effort to write this help page.<br>
