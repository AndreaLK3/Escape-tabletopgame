<h4><big><big><big><big><a name="client"></a></big></big>Client
operations, aka Play the
Actual game</big></big></h4>

<big>
<small style="text-decoration: underline;">Preparations</small><br>
</big>
<ol>

  <li>Set the port number in the main menu, the default 1337 works most
of the times</li>
  <li>Click Start Client, then enter the ip / hostname of the server
you want to join</li>
  <li>Wait for the game to start</li>
  <li>A popup will notify you when your turn starts<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The main interface</span><br>

The connection status, game status and turn number are displayed on the
top row.<br>

The left side of the screen contains the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">tactical panel</span>", showing the info
you possess<br>

about yourself and the other players, those data are automatically
gathered by the game<br>

for your convenience.<br>

<br>

Under the global data about all the players are located the specific <span style="font-weight: bold;">info about your character</span>:<br>

name, status, team. You may change your name by editing it and pressing
enter.<br>

<br>

Under your personal data, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">turn
status</span> is displayed (who is currently playing)<br>

<br>

The in-game <span style="font-weight: bold;">chat</span> interface is
located at the bottom of the left panel, you can use it as any other<br>

chat system you've seen before.<br>

<br>

The right of the screen is occupied by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">game map</span>, it will show your
position, as well as any<br>

noteworthy event occurring during the game; to move your character,
place noises, or turn on<br>

the lights, you must select a cell by clicking it.<br>

<br>

Finally, the bottom row of the interface contains the <span style="font-weight: bold;">view object cards</span> button, it shows a
dialog<br>

with the cards that are currently in your possession. When you have to
play a card, simply bring<br>

it up, click on the card, and press ok.<br>

When you have drawn a new card, an hint is displayed in the bottom left
of the screen.<br>

<br>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The turn sequence</span><br>

The turn sequence is unchanged from the tabletop version (advanced
ruleset), but keep<br>

in mind that turns have a precise time limit (around 60 seconds), and,
if you take too much<br>

time, you will lose the rest of your turn.<br>

<br>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disconnection<br>
</span>The game abandon is permanent, meaning that you can not
disconnect and the reconnect again<br>

and continue the game; disconnected characters (aka "idle") won't be removed from
the map, but will not<br>

figure among the winners, and will always skip their subsequent turns.<br>
<br style="text-decoration: underline;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Command-line client</span><br>
The command-line only client doesn't require much explanation, as clear
and direct textual instruction will be shown as you play. A printed
version of the current map, some sheet of paper and a pencil to take
notes may come in handy.<br>
A minimal help message will also be shown if you type the command "help".<br>
<small>
</small>
<h4><big><big><a name="house_rules"></a>Notable differences from the
tabletop version, aka The House Rules<br>
</big></big></h4>

<ol>

  <li>If a player lost his turn (by waiting too long / being AFK), the
server will
take over and end the turn in his behalf, by moving the player around
randomly and choosing the dumbest option available when prompted (i.e.
don't play cards, discard the first card in the hand, make noise and
lights in the player's own sector). Note that this event is different
from a disconnection; being AFK won't mark an user as idle,while disconnecting does. <br>
</li>
</ol>

<h4><small>
</small><big><big><a name="server"></a>Server operations</big></big></h4>

<big>
<small style="text-decoration: underline;">Preparations<br>
</small></big>
<ol>

  <li>For the server, it's important to set the right <span style="font-weight: bold;">networking mode</span></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Choose Socket, RMI or Socket + RMI from the Server Settings
row, in the main menu</li>
    <li>Please note that the network mode chosen here will influence
how the port will be used</li>
  </ul>
  <li>If you want to use a custom <span style="font-weight: bold;">port</span>
(1337 is fine most of the times, though) for incoming connections,
input it in the "port field", then hit the "set port" button</li>
  <ul>
    <li>NOTE: if you are using RMI, the registry port (1099) will be
listening, too.</li>
    <li>OTHER
NOTE: if you are using RMI + Socket, RMI will take over the displayed
port (i.e. 1337), then Socket will try to listen on the next avaible
one (i.e. 1338)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Click "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Start Server</span>", and
the server will be up and running in a few seconds.</li>
  <li>Now you may want to communicate your ip/hostname to your users,
and let the game begin!</li>
  <ul>
    <li>NOTE: as stated before, RMI + Server will setup the two
services on two
different ports. If that's the case, you should inform your users,
since the default port will be reserved to RMI. Any <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ol>

<ul>

  <li>To allow others to connect, you may want to open the chosen ports
on your <span style="font-weight: bold;">firewall</span>, the exact
procedures vary between different operating systems.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: we don't recommend opening
the registry port (1099), as it could compromise the security of your
system.<br>

<ul>

  <li>You may also want to allow connections from the whole internet
(and not just your LAN). To do so, you must configure your
router/gateway to forward said ports; again, the exact <span style="font-weight: bold;">port-forwarding</span> procedure varies
between different machines. If you have trouble with port forwarding,
these online tools can be helpful: <a href="http://www.yougetsignal.com/">http://www.yougetsignal.com/</a><br>
  </li>
</ul>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: we don't recommend
forwarding the registry port, either.<br>

<br style="text-decoration: underline;">

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The main interface</span><br>

The server interface is rough, and is intended to simply display the <span style="font-weight: bold;">server's logs</span>, be it from the
terminal<br>

or inside a window.<br>

The window does also display the server uptime, and offers buttons to:<br>

Stop the server<br>

Dump the logs (the file will show up in your working directory, usually
the same as the executable .jar)<br>

<br>

The server process will always try to go down gracefully (whether you
stop it via gui or by sending a SIGINT),<br>

by stopping all the games and then disconnecting all the users.<br>

<br>

The server will automatically join new users to the same game; if said
game is full / already running, a new game instance will be created,
new users will be routed here, and so on.<br>

The actual match will also start a fixed amount of time (default: 60
seconds, but it's customizable) after the minimum number of players is
met (2 players).<br>

<h4><big><big><a name="cli"></a>Command line parameters</big></big></h4>

<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></h4>

The application is intended to work in <span style="font-weight: bold;">headless
environments</span> as well, but you need to use command line
parameters to correctly set it up:<br>

<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 276px;">--gm-timeout
[milliseconds]<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 757px;">Set the duration
after which the game will automatically start, given a minimum number
of players waiting in the game room<br>
      </td>

      <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 757px;">Set the absolute
duration of a player's turn. When this time runs out, the computer will
automatically concude the turn, in place of the user. The default is 60
seconds.<br>

sessions.<br>

<h4><big><big><a name="faq"></a>Not So FAQ:</big></big></h4>

Q: How often will new updates come out?<br>

A: The program is fixed-deadline university project, this means you
probably* won't see any updates after June, 2015.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * who knows, life is strange sometimes.<br>

<br>

Q: My computer is an 80s IBM-PC, can I play too?<br>

A: The protocol used by the Socket subsystem employs human-readable
strings (kinda like SMTP does), this means that you can connect to an
eftaios server via telnet / netcat and play, the interface is not so
different from the cli-client provided by the application. Obviouly,
the server must be hosted on a java capable computer.<br>

<br>

Q: Why is this program better than similar projects?<br>

A: We made the effort to write this help page.<br>
